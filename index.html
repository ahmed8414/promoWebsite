<h1 align="center">Me Vs. The World</h1>
<p align="center"> What an iconic title right? To much of an exaggeration but I mean I made it. I wanted this page to reflect about my life. I just want to express myself. <br> Its a great theraputic
technique to write everything down. Most on paper, but mine on a website. Please click away to a more interesting site that isn't revolving around a narcissistic teen like me. Now onto formal
introductions, my name is <bold class="Name">Ramin Ahmed</bold>. Please enjoy a Q & A kind of interview in which I blab on about my life..</p>
