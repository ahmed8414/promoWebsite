<li>How many people are in your family?</li>
<h4>I currently have 7 people living in my household. Both are my grandparents who visit every year.<br>
    This year in in November, both my grandparents will go back to Pakistan.</h4>
    <br><br><br><br>
<li>Do you have any siblings?</li>
<h4>I'm actually the middle daughter of the family. I have a older sister who is 1 year older than me. She currently resides as a Sophomore in Hoffman Estates High School. <br>
    My younger sister is 7 years younger than me. I agree it is a large age gap. She is a second grader attending Elizabeth Blackwell Elementary.</h4>
    <br><br><br><br>
<li>Have you been to Blackwell before? </li>
    <h4>I did attend Blackwell with my older sister. It ranges from kindergarten to 6th grade. There used to be preschool classes, <br>
    but after a few years it got taken out. My younger sister had to go to another school before coming here. <mark>If you want to learn more about <br>
            the school you can click on the image below.</mark></h4>

    <li>How is your family like?</li>
    <h4>I mean similar to every asian household. Mine is a bit religious as I am a Muslim. My family is a bit crazy and hard to handle, <br>
    but that only shows how kind and caring they are on the inside. That may have sounded cheesy but my family don't ever express their feelings. <br>
    Instead they drive you nuts to disguise what's happening to them. I'm used to it though.</h4>
