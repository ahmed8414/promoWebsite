        <td>Me and my family qualify as South Asians. This term revolves around the region in Asia where I'm from.</td>

    <tr>
    <td>What is your Cultural background exactly?</td>
    <td>I'm a Pakistani American to be percise. Even though my family can also be defined that but I believe it's debatable. <br> My parents and my older sister were directly born in the Pakistan.
    Unlike me and my younger sister, we were born in the U.S while having that cultural background. My sister has lived a long period of time in the U.S to be defined as a Pakistani American.</td>

    <tr>
    <td>Can you tell us more about your family's journey on coming here?</td>
    <td>Of course as immigrants, my family didn't settle completely in the U.S. My father had come to the U.S before marriage. His brothers were the first ones sent to study broad over there. <br>
    My father is the youngest in the family with seven brothers and two sisters. He had went back to Pakistan for marriage. He then wanted to bring my mother here. This of course was a long and hectic process.
    <br> Obtaining passports and other legal documents required years, in those years my older sister was born. Funny story, my father wasn't there during her birth, he was instead in the U.S. On Feburary 14, 2004, my mother had successfully moved with my father to the U.S. <br> This was in 2004, which meant that my mother was pregnant
    with me. Eight months until due. After all this, my parents started off living with my closest uncle. We lived there for a few years as my father looked for a job.<br>
    Then with enough financial stability, he found a home in which I currently reside in. I'm glad he did.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>I heard that your family was very religious. Exactly what Religion do you practice?</td>
    <td> My religion that I practice in is Islam. The term that defines me and my family is muslims. We worship a God called Allah. We have to pray 5 times each day containing other types of prayers. <br>
    One of them is in the middle of the night. Me and my siblings don't pray at that time, but all the adults in my family do. Islam is peace and prosperity. Lately there has been controversial <br>
    debates about what Islam really represents. However, as a Muslim, I know for sure that its sole purpose is to spread peace.</td>

    </td>
    <tr>
    <td>Does your culture play a role in this?</td>
    <td>In South Asia there are regions that practice Islam. However, both India and Pakistan have that demographic of Muslims. Pakistan was apart of India in the 1900s but due to the Muslim minority,
    <br> they had taken into consideration of creating a country based on religious intentions. Pakistan is my home country no matter the circumstances. However, I haven't visited Pakistan since 2011. <br>
    My mother's side of the family resides in Pakistan. Her sister and two brothers. My grandparents come to visit us every year if possible. As I am grateful on being a Pakistani, I'm also grateful on being apart <br>
    of the community here in the U.S. I love my home, neighborhood, school, state, and country.</td>
