    <li>What's your name and age?</li>
    <h4>My name is Ramin Ahmed and I am 14 years old.</h4>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <li>When's your birthday?</li>
    <h4>My birthday is on October 19th. I was born in the 2000s era but people don't usually include 2004 as part of that group. <br> I'm actually turning 15 y/o this year.</h4>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <li>What are your hobbies?</li>
    <h4>I don't have a specific hobby. Usually I like to read and explore alot of book. However, lately due to homework I haven't have time to read any.<br>
    I'm the kind of person who reads more than 60 pages and reads until I feel satisfied on where I end that. This creates the issue of having time management because I have other responsibilities.</h4>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <li>Do you any Nicknames?</li>
    <h4>Yes I do since elementary which was ramen noodles. I know a great name.</h4>

    <li>What's you favorite show or movie?</li>
    <h4> I would say Criminal Minds. It's my favorite crime tv show in which I'll watch over and over without getting bored.</h4>

    <br><br><br><br>
    <li>If you were to describe your personality in three words, what would it be?</li>
    <h4> I would say kind, hardworking, and a bit of an overachiever. My friends, especially my teachers know how extra I am with assignments.
        <br>Mostly projects. I just have this high expectation of myself which causes me to look more further than others.</h4>
    <br><br><br><br>
